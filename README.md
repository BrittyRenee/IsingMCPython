# IsingMCPython
The Ising Model using Monte Carlo methods.
This saves frames of data to the code folder to save results.
This saves the initial and final matrix to the workspace as well.

Has modes for negative and positive biases in results - currently only working for the donut and default lattice. Bias does not work properly for the negative and positive borders yet.

Requires:

numpy
matplotlib
random
math
